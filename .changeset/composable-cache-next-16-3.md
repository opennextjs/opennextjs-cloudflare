fix: replace the whole `loadCustomCacheHandlers` body so Next.js 16.3 chunks don't throw `ReferenceError`

Next.js 16.3 rewrote `loadCustomCacheHandlers`: the declaration that binds `cacheHandlers` now also binds
`cacheMaxMemorySize`, and the native method body consumes both. The composable cache patch replaced only that
declaration, so on the minified runtime chunks (`dist/compiled/next-server/*.runtime.prod.js`) the surviving
native code referenced bindings that were no longer declared. Every request to the Worker then failed with
`ReferenceError: <minified identifier> is not defined` inside `loadCustomCacheHandlers` (site-wide 500s on
Next.js 16.3.x), while builds stayed green because the unminified `next-server.js` short-circuits on
`if (!cacheHandlers) return` before the orphaned binding is read.

The patch now replaces the whole method body while preserving its signature and wires the composable cache
registry to the static `require()` as before, so no native reference to a dropped binding can survive. The
rule still matches pre-16.3 chunks, so older Next.js versions are unaffected.
