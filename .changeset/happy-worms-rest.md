feat: rename the binary from "cloudflare" to "opennextjs-cloudflare"

**BREAKING CHANGE**:
After this change the old way of running the tool (e.g. `pnpm cloudflare`) no longer works.
Going forward use the new binary name (e.g. `pnpm opennextjs-cloudflare`).

See [#161](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-cloudflare/issues/161)
